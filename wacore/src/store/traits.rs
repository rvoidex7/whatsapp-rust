//! Storage traits for the WhatsApp client.
//!
//! This module defines 4 domain-grouped traits that together form the `Backend` trait:
//!
//! - [`SignalStore`]: Signal protocol cryptographic operations (identity, sessions, keys)
//! - [`AppSyncStore`]: WhatsApp app state synchronization
//! - [`ProtocolStore`]: WhatsApp Web protocol alignment (SKDM, LID mapping, device registry)
//! - [`DeviceStore`]: Device persistence operations
