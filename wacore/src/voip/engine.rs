//! The sans-IO call engine: a str0m-shaped state machine that owns the relay control plane (STUN
//! allocate, 1s keepalive, consent-freshness replies) and, optionally, the media plane (MLow
//! encode/decode + E2E-SRTP + SFrame + a 20ms playout jitter buffer). It owns no socket, no clock,
//! and no thread. The shell performs a single mutation (`handle_input`), drains `poll_output()`
//! until it yields `Output::Timeout`, executes each intent, and arms one timer for that deadline.
//!
//! Time is monotonic milliseconds supplied by the shell; the engine never reads a clock. The only
//! non-deterministic input is the STUN transaction id, injected via [`TxIdSource`], so the whole
//! engine is deterministically testable.
//!
//! This is the portable orchestration the example's `run_media` task did by hand, lifted into pure
//! logic so the Tokio driver, the WASM bridge, and (for the control plane) embedded consumers all
//! drive one implementation.
